\begin{abstract}
  Homotopy theory studies spaces up to a homotopy, which is a continuous deformation of one
  continuous function to another. This documents is a work in progress done during a course audit.
  These notes are taken purposefully in English to strenghten intuition
  and simplify lookup of concepts in related literature.

\section{Point-set Topology}

\defn{Topological space}{
  A topological space is a pair $\langle X, \tau \rangle$, where $X$ is a set
  and $\tau$, a topology on X, is a collection of subsets ($\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$)
  called open sets, such that:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\emptyset \in \tau$.
  \item $X \in \tau$.
  \item $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary finite intersections.
  \item $\tau$ is closed under abbitrary unions. \todo{Maybe find some cute notation for this.}
  \end{itemize}
}

\defn{Trivial Topology}{
  A topological space is called trivial, when the topology on $X$
  consists only of $\emptyset$ and $X$.
}

\defn{Discrete Topology}{
  A topological space is called discrete, when $\tau = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
}

\defn{Continuous map}{
  Let $\langle X, \tau \rangle$ and $\langle Y, \sigma \rangle$ be topological spaces.
  A map $f: X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous} if $\forall s \in \sigma, \inv{f}(s) \in \tau$.
  In plain English, a map is continuous when a preimage of an open set in $Y$ is an open set in $X$.

  $C(X,Y)$ denotes a set of all continuous maps between $X$ and $Y$.
}

\todo{Base of topology and methods of inducing topologies on sets were discussed during Lecture 2.}

\todo{Bonus. Compare topology to a field of sets to a $\sigma$-algebra to a Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Discussed during Lecture 5.}


\section{Homotopy}

\defn{Homotopy}{
  Two continuous maps $f, g: X \to Y$ are homotopic if there is a
  map called homotopy $H: X \times [0,1] \to Y$ that \textit{continuously deforms} $f$ to $g$,
  denoted $f \simeq g$ or $f \homotopic{H} g$.
  In general:
  \begin{align*}
    X \times [0,1] &\xrightarrow{H} Y \\
    H(x, 0) &= f(x) \\
    H(x, 1) &= g(x) \\
    H(x, t) &= tf(x) + (1-t)g(x)
  \end{align*}
}

\begin{example}
$1 \homotopic{x^t} x$ when viewed as $x^0$ and $x^1$.
\begin{align*}
  X \times [0,1] &\xrightarrow{H} Y \\
  H(x, 0) &= x^0 \\
  H(x, 1) &= x^1 \\
  H(x, t) &= x^t
\end{align*}
Another possible homotopy between the same functions is $t\cdot{}x + (1-t)\cdot{}1$, which suggsts that there may be many more of them.

\todo{Plots?}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  $\{\cdot\} \times [0,1] -> \mathbb{C}$ with $H(x,t) = e^{2\pi{}it}$
\end{example}

\subsection{Homotopy and equivalence}

\begin{theorem}
  Homotopy equivalence between spaces is an equivalence relation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \ldots
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  A homotopy between continuous maps is an equivalence relation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \ldots
\end{proof}

\subsection{Contractible Spaces}

\defn{Contractibility}{
  A space is contractible if it is homotopically equivalent to a point (a constant map).
}

\defn{Path-connectedness}{
}


\begin{theorem}
  Any convex set is contractible.
\end{theorem}

\defn{Star-convex Set}{}

\begin{theorem}
  Any star-convex set is contractible.
\end{theorem}
