\begin{abstract}
  Homotopy theory studies spaces up to a homotopy, which a continuous deformation of one
  continuous function to another. This documents is a work in progress done during a course audit.
  These notes are taken purposefully in English to strenghten intuition
  and simplify lookup of concepts in related literature.

\section{Notes on Point-set Topology}

\defn{Topological space}{
  A topological space is a pair $\langle X, \tau \rangle$, where $X$ is a set
  and $\tau$, a topology on X, is a collection of subsets ($\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$)
  called open sets, such that:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\emptyset \in \tau$.
  \item $X \in \tau$.
  \item $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary finite intersections.
  \item $\tau$ is closed under abbitrary unions. \todo{Maybe find some cute notation for this.}
  \end{itemize}
}

\defn{Trivial Topology}{
  A topological space is called trivial, when the topology on $X$
  consists only of $\emptyset$ and $X$.
}

\defn{Discrete Topology}{
  A topological space is called discrete, when $\tau = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
}

\defn{Continuous map}{
  Let $\langle X, \tau \rangle$ and $\langle Y, \sigma \rangle$ be topological spaces.
  A map $f: X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous} if $\forall s \in \sigma, \inv{f}(s) \in \tau$.
  In plain English, a map is continuous when a preimage of an open set in $Y$ is an open set in $X$.
}

\todo{Base of topology and methods of inducing topologies on sets were discussed during Lecture 2.}

\todo{Bonus. Compare topology to a field of sets to a $\sigma$-algebra to a Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Discussed during Lecture 5.}
