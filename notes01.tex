\begin{abstract}
  Homotopy theory studies spaces up to a homotopy, which is a continuous deformation of one
  continuous function to another. This documents is a work in progress done during a course audit.
  These notes are taken purposefully in English to strenghten intuition
  and simplify lookup of concepts in related literature.

\section{Set-theoretic Definitions}

\defn{Binary relation}{
  A binary relation R on a set $X$ is a set of ordered pairs of elements of $X$.
}

\defn{Equivalence relation}{\label{def:equivalence}
  An equivalence relation $\sim$ is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
}

\let\OldSim\sim
\renewcommand{\sim}{\hyperref[def:equivalence]{\OldSim}}

\defn{Equivalence class of an element}{\label{def:eqclass}
  Given a set $X$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$, an
  equivalence class of $a \in X$, denoted $[a]$ is a set $\{ x \in S \mid x \sim a \}$
}

\newcommand{\eqclass}[1]{\hyperref[def:eqclass]{[#1]}}

\defn{Quotient Set}{\label{def:quotient-set}
  A quotient set $X/{\sim}$ (also said ``$X$ \textit{modulo} $\sim$'') is a set of all \hyperref[def:eqclass]{equivalence
    classes} of $X$ with respect to $\sim$.
  $$
  X/{\sim} = \{ \eqclass{x} : x \in X \}
  $$
}

\newcommand{\quot}[2]{\hyperref[def:quotient-set]{#1/{#2}}}

\defn{Quotient Map}{\label{def:quotient-map}
  A quotient map is a surjective mapping that sends a point in $X$ to its equivalence class, containing it:
  $q: X \to \quot{X}{\sim}$
}


\section{Point-set Topology}

\defn{Topological space}{\label{def:topology}
  A topological space is a pair $\langle X, \tau \rangle$, where $X$ is a set
  and $\tau$, a topology on X, is a collection of subsets ($\tau \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$)
  called open sets, such that:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\emptyset \in \tau$.
  \item $X \in \tau$.
  \item $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary finite intersections.
  \item $\tau$ is closed under arbitrary unions. \todo{Maybe find cute notation for this.}
  \end{itemize}
}

\newcommand{\topX}{\hyperref[def:topology]{X}}
\renewcommand{\top}[2]{\hyperref[def:topology]{\pair{#1}{#2}}}

\defn{Trivial Topology}{
  A topological space is called trivial, when the topology on $X$
  consists only of $\emptyset$ and $X$.
}

\defn{Discrete Topology}{
  A topological space is called discrete, when $\tau = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
}

\defn{Continuous map}{
  Let $\langle X, \tau \rangle$ and $\langle Y, \sigma \rangle$ be topological spaces.
  A map $f: X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous} if:
  $$
  \forall s \in \sigma, \inv{f}(s) \in \tau
  $$
  In plain English, a map is continuous when a preimage of an open set in $Y$ is an open set in $X$.

  $C(X,Y)$ denotes a set of all continuous maps between $X$ and $Y$.
}

\todo{Base of topology and methods of inducing topologies on sets were discussed during Lecture 2.}

\todo{Bonus. Compare topology to a field of sets to a $\sigma$-algebra to a Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Discussed during Lecture 5.}

\defn{$T_1$ space}{}
\defn{Hausdorff space}{}

\subsection{Quotient Topology}

\todo{Gluing.}

Let $\top{X}{\tau}$ be a topological space and $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $X$.

\defn{Quotient Topogical Space}{
  By analogy of a set and given $q: \top{X}{\tau} \to \top{\quot{X}{\sim}}{\tau_{\quot{X}{\sim}}}$,
  \begin{align*}
    \quot{X}{\sim} & = \{ \eqclass{x} : x \in X \} \\
    \tau_{\quot{X}{\sim}} & = \{ U \subseteq \quot{X}{\sim} \mid \inv{q}(U) \in \tau \}
  \end{align*}

  $\tau_{\quot{X}{\sim}}$ is constructed this way to ensure $q$ is continuous.
}

\begin{theorem}
  Given $Z$ is a topological space, $g$ is a surjective map, $p$ is a quotient map and the following diagram,

  % \[
  %   \begin{tikzcd}[font=\large, row sep=huge, column sep=huge]
  %     \topX \arrow[swap]{d}{p} \arrow{dr}{g \circ p} &
  %     \\
  %     \quot{X}{\sim} \arrow[swap]{r}{g} & Z
  %   \end{tikzcd}
  % \]

  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[font=\large, row sep=huge, column sep=huge]
      \topX \arrow{dr}{p} \arrow{rr}{f = g \circ p} && Z \\
      & \quot{X}{\sim} \arrow{ur}{g}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  $g$ is continuous $\iff$ $f = g \circ p$ is continuous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  Have $z \in \mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{S}^1 = \{ \abs{z} = 1 \}$, $I = [0..1] \subset \vr{1}$.

  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}[font=\large, row sep=huge, column sep=huge]
      I \arrow{dr}{p} \arrow{rr}{f(t\in I) = \e{2i\pi{}t}} && \mathbb{S}^1 \\
      & {\quot{I}{\Delta} = \{0,1\}} \arrow{ur}{g}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{example}



\section{Homotopy}

\defn{Homotopy}{
  Two continuous maps $f, g: X \to Y$ are homotopic if there is a
  map called homotopy $H: X \times [0,1] \to Y$ that \textit{continuously deforms} $f$ to $g$,
  denoted $f \simeq g$ or $f \homotopic{H} g$.
  In general:
  \begin{align*}
    X \times [0,1] &\xrightarrow{H} Y \\
    H(x, 0) &= f(x) \\
    H(x, 1) &= g(x) \\
    H(x, t) &= tf(x) + (1-t)g(x)
  \end{align*}
}

\begin{example}
$1 \homotopic{x^t} x$ when viewed as $x^0$ and $x^1$.
\begin{align*}
  X \times [0,1] &\xrightarrow{H} Y \\
  H(x, 0) &= x^0 \\
  H(x, 1) &= x^1 \\
  H(x, t) &= x^t
\end{align*}
Another possible homotopy between the same functions is $t\cdot{}x + (1-t)\cdot{}1$, which suggsts that there may be many more of them.

\todo{Plots?}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  $\{\cdot\} \times [0,1] \to \mathbb{C}$ with $H(x,t) = e^{2\pi{}it}$
\end{example}

\subsection{Homotopy and Equivalence}

\begin{theorem}
  Homotopy equivalence between spaces is an \nameref{def:equivalence}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \ldots
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  A homotopy between continuous maps is an \nameref{def:equivalence}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \ldots
\end{proof}

\subsection{Contractible Spaces}

\defn{Contractibility}{
  A space is contractible if it is homotopically equivalent to a point (a constant map).
}

\defn{Path-connectedness}{
}


\begin{theorem}
  Any convex set is contractible.
\end{theorem}

\begin{elemma}
  Contractibility does not depend on a choice of a point.
\end{elemma}

\defn{Star-convex Set}{}

\begin{theorem}
  Any star-convex set is contractible.
\end{theorem}
